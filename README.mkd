# Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code
2018](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

They were developed in Common Lisp on [SBCL](http://sbcl.org) 1.5.5.

Each daily puzzle has its own package and exports two functions `RUN1` and
`RUN2` which return each part of the solution.
