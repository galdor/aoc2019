# Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code
2018](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

They were developed in Common Lisp on [SBCL](http://sbcl.org) 1.5.5.

Each daily puzzle has its own package and exports a `RUN` function that
accepts the path of the input file and returns two values for the two levels
of the puzzle.
