# Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code
2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

They were developed in Common Lisp on [SBCL](http://sbcl.org) 1.5.5.

Each daily puzzle has its own package and exports three functions:
- `RUN1` and `RUN2` which return each part of the solution.
- `CHECK` which runs both functions and validates the results, raising a
  condition if they are incorrect.
